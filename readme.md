The dataset consists of three csv files; primary order information, order details, and monthly sales targets by category. The csv files were combined into a three table database file using DB Browser for SQLite. SQL queries are run in a Jupyter Notebook via ipython-sql, and query results are saved as variables when needed for further exploration, transformation and/or visualization.

## Description

This EDA will observe sales, margin and category performance information, and further segmentation will be performed where appropriate to potentially identify weaknesses or areas where improvement might be considered.
